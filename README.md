# Odin-Landing-Page
This is a project I did when I was doing The Odin Project Curriculum.


This is a tatic landing page project which I did when I was completing "The Odin Project" curriculum. This project was the part of Foundation section of that curriculum. The Landing page project is to show my basic ability and skills in HTML and CSS. Thank you.
